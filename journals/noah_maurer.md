Today we are working on getting our spotify api working in our backend. We had some trouble yesterday getting it all working properly but today we think we have a good understanding on where to go with it.
All of our api routes for our users and reviews work, so we feel solid that our backend is coming together nicely.
Got all of our Spotify routes working. Had some extra stuff we did not want so we found a way to return it without it
